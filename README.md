# AI-TRIP PLANNER üöÄ

AI Trip Planner is a smart travel application that generates a unique itinerary for its travelers by utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. By leveraging the ability to analyze its user's travel preferences, history, interests, and budget, this system can recommend the best destination, accommodation, attraction and activities to do at that destination. This system will have an optimized routing and scheduling tool for planning your trip making it easier for the user to spend less time planning and more time enjoying their vacation. The project demonstrates how AI can be applied to real-world problems like decision making and travel planning while providing hopefully a more comfortable user experience.
